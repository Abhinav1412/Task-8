# Task 8: Sales Dashboard – Data Analyst Internship

## Overview
This task was about creating a simple, interactive **sales dashboard** to explore how sales perform across different **regions**, **product categories**, and over **time**. I used the popular **Superstore dataset** and built the dashboard using **Power BI**, with some help from **Python** for data cleaning.

## Dataset Used
- **File**: `Superstore_sales.csv`
  - I started with the original Superstore sales file and used Python (Pandas) to:
  - Convert the `Order Date` into a `Month-Year` format
  - Clean up the structure to make it ready for Power BI

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas) – for preprocessing the data
- **Power BI** – for creating the interactive dashboard

## Dashboard Visuals
Here’s what I included in the dashboard:
1. **Line Chart** – Shows total sales over time (by Month-Year)
2. **Bar Chart** – Compares sales across different regions
3. **Donut Chart** – Visualizes sales by product category
4. **Slicer/Filter** – Lets users filter the dashboard by region for better exploration

I also used color formatting to highlight the top-performing regions and categories, making it easy to spot what’s doing well at a glance.

## Deliverables
- Power BI dashboard (PDF/screenshot exported)
- key insights in a text file (included)
- Cleaned dataset used for visuals
- This README file

## Notes
This project helped me understand how to combine data cleaning with simple but effective visual storytelling. Power BI’s slicers and formatting features were especially useful for making the dashboard interactive and insightful.
